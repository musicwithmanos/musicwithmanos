      <h2>Meet Dr Manos Charalabopoulos</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I am Manos and my mission is to help you become the musician you want to be.

        How will I do this?

        I will provide you with the insight, both technical and strategic, that you need to set great goals and to reach them. In our first session, we will discuss your musical ambitions and craft a plan of action together. After that, it's all problem-solving. Every challenge that paves the way to our destination, from learning how to play a piece on the piano, to composing your first song 

        Why should you trust me?




        I am fanatical about learning and love sharing my discoveries about music (and the world) with others. Knowledge and, dare I say, wisdom are my ultimate currency. As the son of two Royal Academy of Music graduates (a pianist and a violinist), I have had the privilege of being guided by the best since an early age. I am proud and honoured to have inherited the torch of the classical music tradition, as well as a love for all kinds of music from my parents and many other distinguished teachers. You can read more about my educational experiences at three leading UK universities (including Oxford), three conservatoires (one British, one French and one Greek) and various summer academies <a href="" class="">here</a>. Since beginning to teach music formally in 2012, I have continued to grow alongside my students, learning from your tastes, aspirations and challenges. My job is to provide you with the tools that you need to reach your goals: insight, ideas and inspiration. Over to you now - what kind of music do you dream of making?
